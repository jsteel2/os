# le operating system
goal is to have a UNIX-like system that can run a shell and maybe a text editor (also i want to port it to x86_64 eventually so it can run on my own hardware)

currently, not very close to this (i dont really know what im doing)

all this code is probably shit and will bite me in the ass later, so if i were you i wouldnt use this as a reference

if you have any advice for me, please make an issue and tell me about it...
